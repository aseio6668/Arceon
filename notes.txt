for machien learning, a set of texts based ont he games lore (self written) will be prestend to npcs which will have 'machine learning (text)' capabilitiy; i can use an app within this games project space to include a folder 'gametrainingdata' for the npcs to run training (using cuda) and make judgements of how to generate books in the game. The books will be able to be read by other npcs, and from what they leran they will have the ability to write in game and so on, which would lead to a living lexical ecosystem to self-evolve . the npcs should be programmed at start to do basic core tasks based on their type - such as a farmer would tend to crops, if they were bound to a home, they would do 'housework' like eating cleaning taking care of things; a trader woul dinteract with other traders;  some will enjoy reading more, such as scholars or anyone, students; The npcs in all will be able to craft items also, from gathering such as a player can, and also construct towns ; this will basically allow the world to evolve on its own in live-mode where players will be part of the adventure.
